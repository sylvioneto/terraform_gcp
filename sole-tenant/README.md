# Windows Sole-Tenant

This example creates an environment to demonstrate how to use Sole Tenant nodes to host your Windows Servers VMs.

You can use this approach to lift and shift your VMs to Google Cloud using bringing your own licenses ([BYOL](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/bringing-your-own-licenses)).
